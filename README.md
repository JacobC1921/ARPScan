# Net1nf0Stealer

This is a project I have started out of complete boredom. I am to bring you, the user, an experience similar to that of a 90s hacking movie, however it actually works.

I will be making my own tools, and uploading them to this account, for your personal enjoyment.

I start you off with:
## Net1nf0Stealer (information gathering)

This is a simple information gathering tool used for scanning the network for online IP addresses, and their respective hostnames (if applicable)/hardware addreses. It basically mimics netdiscover, but it isn't working for me on the latest AUR package, so I decided to skip `nmap` and make my own.

### <b>WARNING</b> This tool is <i>very</i> noisy, and can be seen very easily. I'm trying to research whether there is a way to ping every single host on the subnet stealthily, but so far, to no prevail.
